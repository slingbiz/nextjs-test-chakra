# Example React App with [chakra-ui](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) and TypeScript

This repository is a **sample project for [Baloon.dev](https://baloon.dev)**.
The goal is to demonstrate how you can use Baloon with a real front-end repository to create Jira issues, make relevant code changes, and preview updates seamlessly.

Weâ€™re using a simple **Next.js + chakra-ui + TypeScript** app as the base project. You can try making changes via Baloon and see how it applies updates across the repo.

ðŸ‘‰ Screenshot and workflow examples will be added soon.

## Notes

Chakra UI supports Gradients and RTL in `v1.1`. To enable RTL, [configure direction and swap](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/features/rtl-support).

For RTL apps, make sure to set `<Html lang="ar" dir="rtl">` inside `_document.ts`.
